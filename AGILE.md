# Agile Methodology

## Kanban Process

The development of the Unique Dining website followed an Agile methodology, specifically using a Kanban board approach to manage tasks and workflow efficiently.

### Why Kanban?

The Kanban process was chosen for its visual and flexible workflow management, allowing tasks to move through development stages in real time. It helped to prioritize tasks, limit work in progress (WIP), and continuously deliver features with clarity and focus.

### Workflows:

The Kanban board was divided into the following key columns: The default board settings were used to add user stories or feature request.

To Do – Tasks selected and ready for development.
In Progress – Tasks currently being worked on.
Done – Fully completed and deployed tasks. (Including Testing)

### Key Benefits Experienced:
Improved visibility of project progress at any time.
Easier collaboration and prioritization of features.
Immediate feedback loops through regular testing and updates.
Flexibility to shift priorities as needed without disrupting the whole process.

### Tools Used:
GitHub Projects.
GitHub Issues linked to Kanban cards for tracking feature requests.
