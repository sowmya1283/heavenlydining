## I. Testing while developing 

During development, the following practices and testing approaches were used to ensure each feature worked correctly and the website remained stable:

Iterative Testing:

- Each page and feature was tested immediately after implementation using a test-as-you-build approach:
- Home Page: Ensured the welcome text, hero image, and CTA buttons appeared correctly during layout and design updates.
- Navigation Bar: Tested navigation links after every style or route update.
- Forms (Login, Signup, Book a Table): Inputs were validated continuously with various edge cases during form development.
- Booking Logic: Booking form submission was tested after each logic update to verify time slot and guest handling.
